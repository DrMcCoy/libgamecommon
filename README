Camoto: Classic-game Modding Tools

Camoto is a collection of utilities for editing (modding) "classic games",
those from the early to mid 1990s.

This is libgamecommon, the lowest-level component of the Camoto suite.  It
contains shared code and routines used by most of the other Camoto libraries.

It is most likely of little use to anyone other than Camoto developers,
although of course it is a prerequisite to installing the rest of the Camoto
suite!

The library currently contains the following elements:

  * substream: C++ iostream for accessing a subsection of another stream.

  * segmented_stream: C++ iostream allowing data to be inserted and removed
    at arbitrary positions within the stream, and the resulting on-disk data
    shuffling only happening once, at flush().

Each element contains a number of tests to confirm it is working as expected,
and these are run in the usual manner: "make check"

The library is compiled and installed in the usual way:

  ./configure && make
  sudo make install
  sudo ldconfig

If you downloaded the git release, run ./autogen.sh before the commands above.

This library is released under the GPLv3 license.
