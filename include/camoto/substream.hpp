		/**
		 * This does not flush any write cache, so if you don't call flush() first,
		 * data you wrote previously may end up in the new place in the parent
		 * stream (but it will still be at the same offset within this substream.)
		 * For example:
		 *
		 * @code
		 * new substream(50);   // create new substream at offset 50 in parent
		 * substream->seek(4);
		 * substream->write("hello"); // may write at offset 54, or may cache
		 * //substream->flush();  // would guarantee "hello" at offset 54 in parent
		 *
		 * substream->relocate(10);   // substream is now at offset 60 in parent
		 * substream->flush();        // may cause "hello" at offset 64 in parent
		 * @endcode
		 *
		 * Generally this is only important when the underlying stream needs to be
		 * modified outside of the substream, such as when it is a
		 * segmented_stream.  If you insert a block of data in the segstream, then
		 * relocate the substream by the same amount, any cached writes will end
		 * up where they should go when they are eventually flushed, taking into
		 * account the new block of data inserted into the segstream.  This avoids
		 * the need to flush the substream before inserting data into the
		 * segstream.  To illustrate:
		 *
		 * @code
		 * // parent stream: AAAABBBBCCCCDDDD
		 * new substream(4,8);  // ==> BBBBCCCC
		 * substream->write("hello"); // overwrite the B's and a C with "hello"
		 *   // cached     ==> parent AAAABBBBCCCCDDDD (i.e. unchanged, will write later @ offset 4)
		 *   // not cached ==> parent AAAAhelloCCCDDDD (immediate writethrough @ offset 4)
		 * parent->insert(...); // ==> AAAA___BBBBCCCCDDDD
		 * @endcode
		 *
		 * At this point, the substream wants to write its data at offset 4 in
		 * the parent, but since we've inserted data that location has now
		 * become offset 7.  So we must relocate the substream to take into
		 * account the newly inserted data:
		 *
		 * @code
		 * substream->relocate(3);
		 * substream->flush(); // parent ==> AAAA___helloCCCDDDD
		 * @endcode
		 *
		 * Here, the insert then flush achieved the same result as a flush then
		 * insert would've (which is good.)  If we hadn't done the relocate:
		 *
		 * @code
		 * //substream->relocate(3);
		 * substream->flush(); // parent ==> AAAAhelloBBCCCCDDDD
		 * @endcode
		 * Now the flush has written the data to the wrong place in the parent
		 * stream!  We were supposed to overwrite all the B's and a C but that
		 * didn't happen.
		 *
		 * For this reason, relocating a substream after a major segstream change
		 * is crucial to avoid data corruption.
		 *
		 * @see getOffset()

/// C++ iostream class for accessing a portion of another stream.
/**
 * This class provides a standard C++ iostream that is used to access a
 * particular area within another C++ iostream.
 *
 * An example is opening a .zip file as a stream, then creating a substream
 * to provide access to a single file's data within the main .zip.  As far as
 * any functions using the substream are concerned, there is no difference
 * between accessing a file on disk and the substream (even though writes to
 * the substream are transparently written back into the appropriate place in
 * the parent stream.)
 *
 * One of the few exceptions to this transparency is that substreams do not
 * automatically resize when data is written past EOF.  If data is written past
 * the end of the stream, an error is returned.
 *
 * \todo Currently because of boost::iostreams caching, an error is not
 *       returned and the data is silently discarded.  The
 *       substream_write_then_move test checks for this, and currently fails.
 *
 * Example use:
 * @code
 * std::fstream file("test.txt");
 * substream sub(file, 10, 20);
 * sub << "hello";  // Write "hello" at offset 10 in test.txt
 *
 * // Since it's a C++ iostream, it can be stored in that type
 * std::iostream standard = sub;
 *
 * // However you will need to convert it back to its native type before you
 * // can call any advanced functions.
 * substream backagain = dynamic_cast<substream>(standard);
 * assert(backagain != NULL);
 * backagain.relocate(5);
 * @endcode
